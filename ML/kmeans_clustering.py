Task:
To check level effectivity of a algorithm, we do an example.
Firstly, we choose center for each cluster and create data for each cluster
by picking sample according to standard distribution is expected to center
of that cluster and covariance matrix is unit matrix
"""


"""
We need to declare neccessary libraries. 
We need numpy and matplotlib for computatiing matrix and display data.
We need one more library scipy.spatial.distance to computate distance 
between pairs point in two set of points efectively

Then, we create d√¢t by taking points according to standard distribution

covariance matrixs are the same and are unit matrix.
Each cluster has 500 points
